Cartwheels Site
==============

## About
This is the code for the Cartwheels website, soon to be hosted at 'cartwheels.us.'  It uses ruby on rails as the primary web framework.

## Workflow

### Branches
- `master` :: For completed work only, and can have `develop` rebased onto it. Versions will be released from this branch.
- `develop` :: The culmination of functional work from all of the feature branches. Not as extensively tested as `master`.
- `feature/*` :: Work on specific parts of the site, e.g. `feature/models`.
